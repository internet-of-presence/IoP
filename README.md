# IoP
IoP is the short term for Internet of Presence - Internet 4.0 + Industrie 5.0 - IoP

The Term got invented 2022 by Frank Lemanschik a German Engineer who researched over 30 years on DeFi Solutions and Decentral Social Systems aka Liberty. He spend also a lot of years with the Conception and Planning of Tooling to Imrpove Release Speed and Maintance Cycles as also develop software faster time to market.

## List of Projects that lead to this final Draft
Maybe the following list will never make full sense for a lot of people but for me as of time of writing this it makes a lot of sense because all this Projects got started as i got the vision that it is do able Platforms like Twitch Growed Tik Tok and so on. I Simply now joined this Trends with my Current Visions and Projects
and Created IoP The Internet of Presence where Humans and Companys got a Real Presence!

- Live Streaming
- Open-PWA
- Open Communitys
- Over 200 Blockchain Implementations and Ideas that got reviewed and Analyzed
- Franks own Blockchain Fork github Money Concepts that did not found a final name before IoP Got Invented.
- WebRTC Quic/HTTP3
- Many Years of Security Research and Hacking for Education!
- Many Years of Work as a Software Developer and Consultant for Companys.
- Research and Work in the W3C Groups as also Coding Language Development
- WASM
- Virtual machines (Abstraction of Hardware) Also did that for fun and hacking it is unlimited powerfull
- Many Years of Research in Distributed Systems Software Deployments as also Administration Issues.
- Many Years of Private Social Life Expirence Off and Online

## Why?
The Internet did grow well but there is a lot of dead stuff in it today we have the abilitys to bring it to Life again. Introducing the Needed Tech Stacks to give every PC Owner the Power to have a Online Presence without the need for a Provider! We give the Power Back to the People. There was a Project coming up while i was working on my stuff the EU Europe called it Gaia X a Cloud. I was thinking and laughthing about it because i realised that they simply try to copy amazon and then get less bound to them. Then they realised that without inovation they can not create anything so they decided to copy steal and call it a standard. They are not even able to do that.

I saw the need to give people the ability to self host some stuff in the Internet < 4.0 so i worked on stuff like Docker and Containers. Google Adopted it early and so did amazon and the others because it was geek stuff ok? i am working on stuff like firecracker which amazon released 2022 since more then a decad.

I did most time never released my fully working products to the wild because of the support overhead but while i did design them and test and run them most time for none profit only for education and proof of concept that i am correct whith my thesis!

I also did realise and worked on issues that developers do face when they want to test and create something. On my Research i found a lot of solutions for every problem that i was working on but all did not fit into a one size fit all solution!

I often lost my hope into the humans and the whole world i gave up many times but something always gave me new inputs and then finally i now today fully aware realised that i did Invent something unplanned unexpected the IoP.



## How?
The Core Tech behind it is that Quic will work with and without Http3 so we can introduce a whole internet based on Quic which is similar to WebRTC which is used today to do live chats and video multimedia streaming and also p2p blockchain and all kind of other stuff it is Really the Internet 2.0 as the 1.0 was TCP/IP HTTP based the Internet 2.0 (My Real versioning) is now able to work with other protocols UDP and the internet is no longer bound to the presenter Protocol HTTP.

A little Example lets drop the Web Browser lets imagin it does not exist while messengers exist.

Long years befor i Invented a Protocol Draft to replace HTTP with WASM over HTTP so that we Expose directly the Graphic hardware via Vulkan API's and OpenGL all this low level internals and allow a remote software to directly draw to the context without a interpreter between that the client is not aware how the pixels come to life.

Based on my research on that i can now clear say we can Eliminate all Web Browser and Implement Quic into everything and this way allow directly connections between diffrent software without a man in the middel and with custom even obfusicated (TOR Network) Routing logic. The Only way to censor then is droping Physical Connections via Wire or blocking wlan and maybe EmP the whole Area. But i also worked with the CCC and Many other People on Building Blocks (Kits) and Guides to create new Physical Connections without the need of a Authority to do so.

I was also working on such Project with Chineese People that where researching Internet over Email Protocols. 

## Collections of Moments as the vision got real
Often i was working with google Products on Google Products and realised that gmail is a good example how a simple communication protocol can be abstracted into something more powerfull for example they did link hangouts directly with logging into gmail this way it was unified no matter if the message was from the hangouts protocol or mail protocol everything is simply a message stored some where in some formart.
